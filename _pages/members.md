**Shintaro Ae**<br>
PhD student<br>
Co-supervision with David Tew Chemistry, Oxford<br>

My research interest generally lies in the development of quantum algorithms for quantum chemistry. In particular, I am interested in Hamiltonian simulation, developing methods to simulate system dynamics governed by a given Hamiltonian. My past work includes the Hamiltonian simulation using quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) with randomized block encoding, which is particularly suited for quantum chemistry. I also have experience in the development of superconducting quantum computers.<br>

  <summary>I am a Visiting Researcher at Queen Mary University of London, working on open quantum systems and quantum state engineering. My work examines the behaviour of open dissipation-driven and interacting many-body systems, and quantum information processing in realistic environments, with emphasis on quantum non-Markovian dynamics, and many-body quantum effects with applications to quantum error correction, quantum control, and ground state preparation on near-term devices.</summary><br>
Previously, I was a Researcher at the Hong Kong Research Center of Huawei, where I developed quantum-based algorithms for optimization. Prior to that, I was working with Prof. Vlatko Vedral at the University of Oxford, focusing on quantum collision models for steady-state preparation and error mitigation.<br><br>
