Alexander Yosifov 

I am a Visiting Researcher at Queen Mary University of London, working on open quantum systems and quantum state engineering. Previously, I was a Researcher at the Hong Kong Research Center of Huawei, where I developed quantum-based algorithms for optimization. Prior to that, I was working with Prof. Vlatko Vedral at the University of Oxford, focusing on quantum collision models for steady-state preparation and error mitigation.

My work examines the behavior of open dissipation-driven and interacting many-body systems, and quantum information processing in realistic environments, with emphasis on quantum non-Markovian dynamics, and many-body quantum effects with applications to quantum error correction, quantum control, and ground state preparation on near-term devices.
