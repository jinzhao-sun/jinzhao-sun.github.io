We are looking for highly motivated PhD students and Postdoc researchers to join or visit our group at either QMUL or University of Oxford. We would work together to advance the frontiers of quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum simulation. 


**Funded PhD positions**

**PhD Position 1**: Deadline for application - **28th of January 2026**

Topic: Quantum computing and quantum many-body simulation.

See project description: [link](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spcs/ccmp/phd-at-ccmp/phd-projects-in-ccmp/quantum-computing-and-quantum-many-body-simulation/)

  <summary>Description here</summary><br>
You will work on a range of closely connected topics, which, for example, may include:
 
1. Complexity of quantum dynamics, and quantum simulation. 
 
Study the fundamental computational complexity involved in simulating the time evolution of many-body quantum systems. This includes exploring links with quantum thermalisation, open quantum system dynamics, and the emergence of classical behaviour. We will develop new quantum algorithms for simulating quantum processes more efficiently.
 
2.  Quantum algorithms
 
We will investigate the potential for quantum computers in quantum problems. This includes finding eigenstates of many-body Hamiltonians, simulating quantum dynamics, Hamiltonian learning, quantum thermalisation, and characterising phases of matter. Insights may have implications for quantum error correction, non-Markovian behaviour, quantum memory effects, and noise-resilient quantum computation. 
 
3. New notions of quantum computation
 
We will also explore quantum sensing and spectroscopy from a quantum-computational perspective. This will link concepts from quantum information with physical notions such as correlations functions, response theory and fingerprints of many-body systems. We may think about new notions of quantum computing that is beyond current ‘qubit’ and ‘qumode’ frameworks.

**Postdoc fellowships**
<br>
We welcome and support applications for postdoctoral-level research fellowships. We also have a separate route for postdoctoral researchers with research proposals in **mathematics**-related directions. If your background or interests align with this area, you're particularly encouraged to reach out. Note that QMUL runs an internal selection process for postdoctoral fellowship applications. Drop me a line if you'd like to apply through my group at QMUL, and we could put together a strong application.

1. [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship (MSCA)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spcs/ctp/opportunities/fellowships/), QMUL internal deadline in early July, decision in February  
2. [Newton International Fellowship](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spcs/ctp/opportunities/fellowships/), internal deadline in February, decision in August
3. Stephan Hawking Postdoctoral Fellowship (3 years)
4. Royal Commission 1851 Fellowship (3 years), deadline in November/December, decision in summer
5. [Marshall Sherfield Fellowship](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/apply/marshall-sherfield/), deadline in December 2025, decision in January. US applicants only
6. EPSRC postdoctoral fellowship. The current round only supports applications in mathematics or energy.


Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in joining or visiting the group, either short-term or long-term.
