I am a researcher in quantum computing and quantum physics at Oxford where I am a Schmidt AI in Science Fellow. My research revolves around quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum many-body physics. My research lies in the exploration of quantum computing as a means to address problems that present challenges for classical computing. I aim to uncover the potential power of quantum computing, and examine whether it holds advantages in tackling quantum many-body problems. 

I have a broad interest in quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum many-body physics, which include
* Quantum computing
  *  Quantum algorithms for eigenstate problems and dynamics problems
  *  Hybrid quantum-classical computing
  *  Quantum simulation of molecules and materials
  *  Addressing the challenges with near-term quantum devices
* Quantum error mitigation and its transition to quantum error correction
* Quantum computational chemistry
* Quantum many-body physics, e.g., high-temperature superconductivity, magnetism and topology
  
Find some interesting research topics and descriptions of my selected research works under **Research**. 

A beginner's guide to quantum computing could be found in my thesis below. Some philosophical discussions on the notion of quantum machines, quantum simulation and spectroscopy can also be found there.
