I have been working on quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum many-body physics. I joined Queen Mary University of London as a faculty member (permanent) in 2025. I am holding a Schmidt AI in Science fellowship at the University of Oxford, where I also serve as the college advisor at Reuben College Oxford.

I am very fortunate to be supervised by Vlatko Vedral and Andrew Boothroyd and get entangled with them, who navigated my research in the quantum realm. I did postdoctoral research with Tom Gur at Cambridge, Myungshik Kim at Imperial, Andrew Green at University College London, and came back to Oxford supported by the Fellowship. Previously, I was a Visiting Scholar of Wolfson College Oxford, and a member of [Jesus College](https://www.jesus.ox.ac.uk/) Oxford with a college scholarship. The college crest of Jesus College features three deer, and I am happy to have one surrounding me.
