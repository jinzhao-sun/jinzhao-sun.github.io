We are looking for highly motivated PhD students and researchers to visit or join our group. We would work together to advance the frontiers of quantum computing, quantum information, and quantum simulation. 

We welcome and support applications for postdoctoral-level research fellowships. Note that QMUL runs an internal selection process for postdoctoral fellowship applications. Drop me a line if you'd like to apply, and we could put together a strong application.

1. [Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship (MSCA)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spcs/ctp/opportunities/fellowships/), QMUL internal deadline in early July, decision in February  
2. [Newton International Fellowship](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spcs/ctp/opportunities/fellowships/), internal deadline in February, decision in August
3. Stephan Hawking Postdoctoral Fellowship (3 years)

5. [Marshall Sherfield Fellowship](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/apply/marshall-sherfield/), deadline in December 2025, decision in January. US applicants only
6. EPSRC postdoctoral fellowship. The current round only supports applications in mathematics or energy.


Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in joining or visiting the group, either short-term or long-term.
