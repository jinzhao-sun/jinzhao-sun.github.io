We welcome and support applications for postdoctoral-level research fellowships. We also have a separate route for postdoctoral researchers with research proposals in **mathematics**-related directions. If your background or interests align with this area, you're particularly encouraged to reach out. Note that QMUL runs an internal selection process for postdoctoral fellowship applications. Drop me a line if you'd like to apply through my group at QMUL, and we could put together a strong application.

1. [Marie Skłodowska-Curie Postdoctoral Fellowship (MSCA)](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spcs/ctp/opportunities/fellowships/), QMUL internal deadline in early July, decision in February  
2. [Newton International Fellowship](https://www.qmul.ac.uk/spcs/ctp/opportunities/fellowships/), internal deadline in February, decision in August
3. Stephan Hawking Postdoctoral Fellowship (3 years)
4. Royal Commission 1851 Fellowship (3 years), deadline in November/December, decision in summer
5. [Marshall Sherfield Fellowship](https://www.marshallscholarship.org/apply/marshall-sherfield/), deadline in December 2025, decision in January. US applicants only
6. EPSRC postdoctoral fellowship. The current round only supports applications in mathematics or energy.


Feel free to reach out to me if you are interested in joining or visiting the group, either short-term or long-term.
