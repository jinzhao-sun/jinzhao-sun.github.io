**Alexander Yosifov**<br>
<details>
  <summary>I am a Visiting Researcher at Queen Mary University of London, working on open quantum systems and quantum state engineering. My work examines the behaviour of open dissipation-driven and interacting many-body systems, and quantum information processing in realistic environments, with emphasis on quantum non-Markovian dynamics, and many-body quantum effects with applications to quantum error correction, quantum control, and ground state preparation on near-term devices.</summary><br>
Previously, I was a Researcher at the Hong Kong Research Center of Huawei, where I developed quantum-based algorithms for optimization. Prior to that, I was working with Prof. Vlatko Vedral at the University of Oxford, focusing on quantum collision models for steady-state preparation and error mitigation.<br>
